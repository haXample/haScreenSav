1. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
LIFE AND CHARACTER
  There is nothing worth thinking but it has been thought before;
  we must only try to think it again.

2. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  How can a man come to know himself? Never by thinking, but by doing.
  Try to do your duty, and you will know at once what you are worth.

3. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
But what is your duty? The claims of the day.

4. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  The world of reason is to be regarded as a great and immortal being,
  who ceaselessly works out what is necessary,
  and so makes himself lord also over what is accidental.

5. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
The longer I live, the more it grieves me to see man, who occupies his
supreme place for the very purpose of imposing his will upon nature, and
freeing himself and his from an outrageous necessity,--to see him taken
up with some false notion, and doing just the opposite of what he wants
to do; and then, because the whole bent of his mind is spoilt, bungling
miserably over everything.

6. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Be genuine and strenuous; earn for yourself, and look for, grace from
those in high places; from the powerful, favour; from the active and
the good, advancement; from the many, affection; from the individual, love.

7. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Tell me with whom you associate, and I will tell you who you are. If I
know what your business is, I know what can be made of you.

8. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Every man must think after his own fashion; for on his own path he finds
a truth, or a kind of truth, which helps him through life. But he must
not give himself the rein; he must control himself; mere naked instinct
does not become him.

9. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Unqualified activity, of whatever kind, leads at last to bankruptcy.

10. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  In the works of mankind, as in those of nature,
  it is really the motive which is chiefly worth attention.

11. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Men get out of countenance with themselves and others because they treat
the means as the end, and so, from sheer doing, do nothing, or, perhaps,
just what they would have avoided.

12. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Our plans and designs should be so perfect in truth and beauty, that in
touching them the world could only mar. We should thus have the
advantage of setting right what is wrong, and restoring what is	destroyed.

13. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
It is a very hard and troublesome thing to dispose of whole, half-, and
quarter-mistakes; to sift them and assign the portion of truth to its
proper place.

14. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
It is not always needful for truth to take a definite shape; it is
enough if it hovers about us like a spirit and produces harmony; if it
is wafted through the air like the sound of a bell, grave and kindly.

15. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  General ideas and great conceit
  are always in a fair way to bring about terrible misfortune.

16. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  You cannot play the flute by blowing alone: you must use your fingers.

17. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
In Botany there is a species of plants called INCOMPLETE; and just in
the same way it can be said that there are men who are incomplete and
imperfect. They are those whose desires and struggles are out of
proportion to their actions and achievements.

18. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
The most insignificant man can be complete if he works within the limits
of his capacities, innate or acquired; but even fine talents can be
obscured, neutralised, and destroyed by lack of this indispensable
requirement of symmetry. This is a mischief which will often occur in
modern times; for who will be able to come up to the claims of an age so
full and intense as this, and one too that moves so rapidly?

19. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
It is only men of practical ability, knowing their powers and using them
with moderation and prudence, who will be successful in worldly affairs.

20. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  It is a great error to take oneself for more than one is,
  or for less than one is worth.

21. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
From time to time I meet with a youth in whom I can wish for no
alteration or improvement, only I am sorry to see how often his nature
makes him quite ready to swim with the stream of the time; and it is on
this that I would always insist, that man in his fragile boat has the
rudder placed in his hand, just that he may not be at the mercy of the
waves, but follow the direction of his own insight.

22. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
But how is a young man to come of himself to see blame in things which
every one is busy with, which every one approves and promotes? Why
should he not follow his natural bent and go in the same direction as
they?

23. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
I must hold it for the greatest calamity of our time, which lets nothing
come to maturity, that one moment is consumed by the next, and the day
spent in the day; so that a man is always living from hand to mouth,
without having anything to show for it. Have we not already newspapers
for every hour of the day! A good head could assuredly intercalate one
or other of them. They publish abroad everything that every one does, or
is busy with or meditating; nay, his very designs are thereby dragged
into publicity. No one can rejoice or be sorry, but as a pastime for
others; and so it goes on from house to house, from city to city, from
kingdom to kingdom, and at last from one hemisphere to the other,--all
in post haste.

24. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
As little as you can stifle a steam-engine, so little can you do this in
the moral sphere either. The activity of commerce, the rush and rustle
of paper-money, the swelling-up of debts to pay debts--all these are
the monstrous elements to which in these days a young man is exposed.
Well is it for him if he is gifted by nature with a sober, quiet
temperament; neither to make claims on the world out of all proportion
to his position, nor yet let the world determine it.

25. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
But on all sides he is threatened by the spirit of the day, and nothing
is more needful than to make him see early enough the direction in which
his will has to steer.

26. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
The significance of the most harmless words and actions grows with the
years, and if I see any one about me for any length of time, I always
try to show him the difference there is between sincerity, confidence,
and indiscretion; nay, that in truth there is no difference at all, but
a gentle transition from what is most innocent to what is most hurtful;
a transition which must be perceived or rather felt.

27. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Herein we must exercise our tact; otherwise in the very way in which we
have won the favour of mankind, we run the risk of trifling it away
again unawares. This is a lesson which a man learns quite well for
himself in the course of life, but only after having paid a dear price
for it; nor can he, unhappily, spare his posterity a like expenditure.

28. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Love of truth shows itself in this, that a man knows how to find and
value the good in everything.

29. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  Character calls forth character.

30. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
If I am to listen to another man's opinion, it must be expressed
positively. Of things problematical I have enough in myself.

31. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Superstition is a part of the very being of humanity; and when we fancy
that we are banishing it altogether, it takes refuge in the strangest
nooks and corners, and then suddenly comes forth again, as soon as it
believes itself at all safe.

32. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  I keep silence about many things,
  for I do not want to put people out of countenance;
  and I am well content if they are pleased with things that annoy me.

33. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  Everything that frees our spirit without giving us control of ourselves
  is ruinous.

34. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  A man is really alive only when he delights in the good-will of others.

35. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  Piety is not an end, but a means:
  a means of attaining the highestculture by the purest tranquillity of soul.

36. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Hence it may be observed that those who set up piety as an end and
object are mostly hypocrites.

37. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  When a man is old he must do more than when he was young.

38. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  To fulfil a duty is still always to feel it as a debt,
  for it is never quite satisfying to oneself.

39. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Defects are perceived only by one who has no love; therefore, to see
them, a man must become uncharitable, but not more so than is necessary
for the purpose.

40. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
The greatest piece of good fortune is that which corrects our
deficiencies and redeems our mistakes.

41. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Reading ought to mean understanding; writing ought to mean knowing
something; believing ought to mean comprehending; when you desire a
thing, you will have to take it; when you demand it, you will not get
it; and when you are experienced, you ought to be useful to others.

42. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
The stream is friendly to the miller whom it serves; it likes to pour
over the mill wheels; what is the good of it stealing through the valley
in apathy?

43. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Whoso is content with pure experience and acts upon it has enough of
truth. The growing child is wise in this sense.

44. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Theory is in itself of no use, except in so far as it makes us believe
in the connection of phenomena.

45. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  When a man asks too much and delights in complication,
  he is exposed to perplexity.

46. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Thinking by means of analogies is not to be condemned. Analogy has this
advantage, that it comes to no conclusion, and does not, in truth, aim
at finality at all. Induction, on the contrary, is fatal, for it sets up
an object and keeps it in view, and, working on towards it, drags false
and true with it in its train.

47. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
The absent works upon us by tradition. The usual form of it may be
called historical; a higher form, akin to the imaginative faculty, is
the mythical. If some third form of it is to be sought behind this last,
and it has any meaning, it is transformed into the mystical. It also
easily becomes sentimental, so that we appropriate to our use only what
suits us.

48. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
In contemplation as in action, we must distinguish between what may be
attained and what is unattainable. Without this, little can be achieved,
either in life or in knowledge.

49. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Common-sense, which is here put forward as the genius of humanity, must
be examined first of all in the way it shows itself. If we inquire the
purpose to which humanity puts it, we find as follows: Humanity is
conditioned by needs. If they are not satisfied, men become impatient;
and if they are, it seems not to affect them. The normal man moves
between these two states, and he applies his understanding--his
so-called common-sense--to the satisfaction of his needs. When his needs
are satisfied, his task is to fill up the waste spaces of indifference.
Here, too, he is successful, if his needs are confined to what is
nearest and most necessary. But if they rise and pass beyond the sphere
of ordinary wants, common-sense is no longer sufficient; it is a genius
no more, and humanity enters on the region of error.

50. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
There is no piece of foolishness but it can be corrected by intelligence
or accident; no piece of wisdom but it can miscarry by lack of
intelligence or by accident.

51. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Every great idea is a tyrant when it first appears; hence the advantages
which it produces change all too quickly into disadvantages. It is
possible, then, to defend and praise any institution that exists, if its
beginnings are brought to remembrance, and it is shown that everything
which was true of it at the beginning is true of it still.

52. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Lessing, who chafed under the sense of various limitations, makes one of
his characters say: No one MUST do anything. A clever pious man said:
If a man WILLS something, he must do it. A third, who was, it is true,
an educated man, added: WILL follows upon INSIGHT. The whole circle
of KNOWLEDGE, WILL, and NECESSITY was thus believed to have been
completed. But, as a rule, a man's knowledge, of whatever kind it may
be, determines what he shall do and what he shall leave undone, and so
it is that there is no more terrible sight than ignorance in action.

53. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
  There are two powers that make for peace:
  what is right, and what is fitting.

54. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
Justice insists on obligation, law on decorum. Justice weighs and
decides, law superintends and orders. Justice refers to the individual,
law to society.

55. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections I
The history of knowledge is a great fugue in which the voices of the
nations one after the other emerge.

56. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
If a man is to achieve all that is asked of him, he must take himself
for more than he is, and as long as he does not carry it to an absurd
length, we willingly put up with it.

57. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Work makes companionship.

58. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  People whip curds to see if they cannot make cream of them.

59. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
It is much easier to put yourself in the position of a mind taken up
with the most absolute error, than of one which mirrors to itself
half-truths.

60. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Wisdom lies only in truth.

61. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  When I err, every one can see it; but not when I lie.

62. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Is not the world full enough of riddles already, without our making
  riddles too out of the simplest phenomena?

63. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  'The finest hair throws a shadow.' (Erasmus).

64. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  What I have tried to do in my life through false tendencies,
  I have at last learned to understand.

65. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Generosity wins favour for every one,
  especially when it is accompanied by modesty.

66. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Before the storm breaks, the dust rises violently for the last time -
  the dust that is soon to be laid forever.

67. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Men do not come to know one another easily, even with the best will and
the best purpose. And then ill-will comes in and distorts everything.

68. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
We should know one another better if one man were not so anxious to put
himself on an equality with another.

69. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Eminent men are therefore in a worse plight than others; for, as we
cannot compare ourselves with them, we are on the watch for them.

70. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
In the world the point is, not to know men, but at any given moment to
be cleverer than the man who stands before you. You can prove this at
every fair and from every charlatan.

71. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Not everywhere where there is water, are there frogs; but where you have
frogs, there you will find water.

72. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Error is quite right as long as we are young,
  but we must not carry it on with us into our old age.

  Whims and eccentricities that grow stale are all useless, rank nonsense.

73. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  In the formation of species Nature gets, as it were, into a "cul-de-sac";
  she cannot make her way through, and is disinclined to turn back.
  Hence the stubbornness of national character.

74. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Every one has something in his nature which, if he were to express it
openly, would of necessity give offence.

75. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
If a man thinks about his physical or moral condition, he generally
finds that he is ill.

76. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Nature asks that a man should sometimes be stupefied without going to
sleep; hence the pleasure in the smoking of tobacco, the drinking of
brandy, the use of opiates.

77. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
The man who is up and doing should see to it that what he does is right.
Whether or not right is done, is a matter which should not trouble him.

78. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Many a man knocks about on the wall with his hammer, and believes that
he hits the right nail on the head every time.

79. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Painting and tattooing of the body is a return to animalism.

80. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  History-writing is a way of getting rid of the past.

81. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  What a man does not understand, he does not possess.

82. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Not every one who has a pregnant thought delivered to him becomes
productive; it probably makes him think of something with which he is
quite familiar.

83. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Favour, as a symbol of sovereignty, is exercised by weak men.

84. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Every man has enough power left to carry out that of which he is convinced.

85. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Memory may vanish so long as at the moment judgment does not fail you.

86. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
No nation gains the power of judgment except it can pass judgment on
itself. But to attain this great privilege takes a very long time.

87. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Instead of contradicting my words people ought to act in my spirit.

88. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Those who oppose intellectual truths do but stir up the fire, and the
cinders fly about and burn what they had else not touched.

89. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Man would not be the finest creature in the world if he were not too
fine for it.

90. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  What a long time people were vainly disputing about the Antipodes!

91. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Certain minds must be allowed their peculiarities.

92. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Snow is false purity.

93. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Whoso shrinks from ideas ends by having nothing but sensations.

94. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Those from whom we are always learning are rightly called our masters;
  but not every one who teaches us deserves this title.

95. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  It is with you as with the sea:
  the most varied names are given to what is in the end only salt water.

96. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
It is said that vain self-praise stinks in the nostrils. That may be so;
but for the kind of smell which comes from unjust blame by others the
public has no nose at all.

97. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
There are problematical natures which are equal to no position in which
they find themselves, and which no position satisfies. This it is that
causes that hideous conflict which wastes life and deprives it of all
pleasure.

98. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  If we do any real good, it is mostly "clam, vi, et precario".

99. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Dirt glitters as long as the sun shines.

100. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
It is difficult to be just to the passing moment. We are bored by it if
it is neither good nor bad; but the good moment lays a task upon us, and
the bad moment a burden.

101. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
He is the happiest man who can set the end of his life in connection
with the beginning.

102. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
So obstinately contradictory is man that you cannot compel him to his
advantage, yet he yields before everything that forces him to his hurt.

103. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Forethought is simple, afterthought manifold.

104. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  A state of things in which every day brings some new trouble
  is not the right one.

105. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
When people suffer by failing to look before them, nothing is
commoner than trying to look out for some possible remedy.

106. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  The Hindoos of the Desert make a solemn vow to eat no fish.

107. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  To venture an opinion is like moving a piece at chess: it may be taken,
  but it forms the beginning of a game that is won.

108. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
It is as certain as it is strange that truth and error come from one and
the same source. Thus it is that we are often not at liberty to do
violence to error, because at the same time we do violence to truth.

109. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Truth belongs to the man, error to his age. This is why it has been said
that, while the misfortune of the age caused his error, the force of his
soul made him emerge from the error with glory.

110. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Every one has his peculiarities and cannot get rid of them; and yet many
a one is destroyed by his peculiarities, and those too of the most
innocent kind.

111. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
If a man does think too much of himself, he is more than he believes
himself to be.

112. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
In art and knowledge, as also in deed and action, everything depends on
a pure apprehension of the object and a treatment of it according to its
nature.

113. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
When intelligent and sensible people despise knowledge in their old age,
it is only because they have asked too much of it and of themselves.

114. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
I pity those who make much ado about the transitory nature of all things
and are lost in the contemplation of earthly vanity: are we not here to
make the transitory permanent? This we can do only if we know how to
value both.

115. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  A rainbow which lasts a quarter of an hour is looked at no more.

116. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
It used to happen, and still happens, to me to take no pleasure in a
work of art at the first sight of it, because it is too much for me; but
if I suspect any merit in it, I try to get at it; and then I never fail
to make the most gratifying discoveries,--to find new qualities in the
work itself and new faculties in myself.

117. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Faith is private capital, kept in one's own house. There are public
savings-banks and loan-offices, which supply individuals in their day of
need; but here the creditor quietly takes his interest for himself.

118. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Real obscurantism is not to hinder the spread of what is true, clear,
  and useful, but to bring into vogue what is false.

119. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
During a prolonged study of the lives of various men both great and
small, I came upon this thought: In the web of the world the one may
well be regarded as the warp, the other as the woof. It is the little
men, after all, who give breadth to the web, and the great men firmness
and solidity; perhaps, also, the addition of some sort of pattern. But
the scissors of the Fates determine its length, and to that all the rest
must join in submitting itself.

120. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Truth is a torch, but a huge one, and so it is only with blinking eyes
that we all of us try to get past it, in actual terror of being burnt.

121. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  "The wise have much in common with one another." (Aschylus).

122. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
The really foolish thing in men who are otherwise intelligent is that
they fail to understand what another person says, when he does not
exactly hit upon the right way of saying it.

123. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
 Because a man speaks, he thinks he is able to speak about language.

124. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
One need only grow old to become gentler in one's judgments. I see no
fault committed which I could not have committed myself.

125. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  The man who acts never has any conscience;
  no one has any conscience but the man who thinks.

126. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Why should those who are happy expect one who is miserable to die before
them in a graceful attitude, like the gladiator before the Roman mob?

127. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Some one asked Timon about the education of his children. 'Let them,' he
said, 'be instructed in that which they will never understand.'

128. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  There are people whom I wish well, and would that I could wish better.

129. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
By force of habit we look at a clock that has run down as if it were
still going, and we gaze at the face of a beauty as though she still
loved.

130. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Hatred is active displeasure, envy passive.
  We need not wonder that envy turns so soon to hatred.


131. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  There is something magical in rhythm;
  it even makes us believe that we possess the sublime.

132. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Dilettantism treated seriously, and knowledge pursued mechanically,
  end by becoming pedantry.

133. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
No one but the master can promote the cause of Art. Patrons help the
master,--that is right and proper; but that does not always mean that
Art is helped.

134. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
The most foolish of all errors is for clever young men to believe that
they forfeit their originality in recognising a truth which has already
been recognised by others.

135. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
Scholars are generally malignant when they are refuting others; and if
they think a man is making a mistake, they straightway look upon him as
their mortal enemy.

136. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections II
  Beauty can never really understand itself.


137. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
It is much easier to recognise error than to find truth; for error lies
on the surface and may be overcome; but truth lies in the depths, and to
search for it is not given to every one.

138. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  We all live on the past, and through the past are destroyed.

139. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
We are no sooner about to learn some great lesson than we take refuge in
our own innate poverty of soul, and yet for all that the lesson has not
been quite in vain.

140. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
The world of empirical morality consists for the most part of nothing
but ill-will and envy.

141. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Life seems so vulgar, so easily content with the commonplace things of
every day, and yet it always nurses and cherishes certain higher claims
in secret, and looks about for the means of satisfying them.

142. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Confidences are strange things. If you listen only to one man, it is
possible that he is deceived or mistaken; if you listen to many, they
are in a like case; and, generally, you cannot get at the truth at all.

143. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
No one should desire to live in irregular circumstances; but if by
chance a man falls into them, they test his character and show of how
much determination he is capable.

144. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
An honourable man with limited ideas often sees through the rascality of
the most cunning jobber.

145. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
If a man feels no love, he must learn how to flatter; otherwise he will
not succeed.

146. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Against criticism a man can neither protest nor defend himself; he must
act in spite of it, and then criticism will gradually yield to him.

147. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
The masses cannot dispense with men of ability, and such men are always
a burden to them.

148. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
If a man spreads my failings abroad, he is my master, even though he
were my servant.

149. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Whether memoirs are written by masters of servants, or by servants of
masters, the processes always meet.

150. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  If you lay duties upon people and give them no rights,
  you must pay them well.

151. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  I can promise to be sincere, but not to be impartial.

152. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Ingratitude is always a kind of weakness.
  I have never known men of ability to be ungrateful.

153. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
We are all so limited that we always think we are right; and so we may
conceive of an extraordinary mind which not only errs but has a positive
delight in error.

154. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
It is very rare to find pure and steady activity in the accomplishment
of what is good and right. We usually see pedantry trying to keep back,
and audacity trying to go on too fast.

155. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Word and picture are correlatives which are continually in quest of each
other, as is sufficiently evident in the case of metaphors and similes.
So from all time what was said or sung inwardly to the ear had to be
presented equally to the eye. And so in childish days we see word and
picture in continual balance; in the book of the law and in the way of
salvation, in the Bible and in the spelling-book. When something was
spoken which could not be pictured, and something pictured which could
not be spoken, all went well; but mistakes were often made, and a word
was used instead of a picture; and thence arose those monsters of
symbolical mysticism, which are doubly an evil.

156. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
For the man of the world a collection of anecdotes and maxims is of the
greatest value, if he knows how to intersperse the one in his
conversation at fitting moments, and remember the other when a case
arises for their application.

157. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  When you lose interest in anything, you also lose the memory for it.

158. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  The world is a bell with a crack in it; it rattles, but does not ring.

159. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
The importunity of young dilettanti must be borne with good-will; for as
they grow old they become the truest worshippers of Art and the Master.

160. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
People have to become really bad before they care for nothing but
mischief, and delight in it.

161. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Clever people are the best encyclopædia.

162. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
There are people who make no mistakes because they never wish to do
anything worth doing.

163. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  If I know my relation to myself and the outer world, I call it truth.
  Every man can have his own peculiar truth; and yet it is always the same.

164. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  No one is the master of any truly productive energy;
  and all men must let it work on by itself.

165. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  A man never understands how anthropomorphic he is.

166. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
A difference which offers nothing to the understanding is no difference
at all.

167. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
A man cannot live for every one; least of all for those with whom he
would not care to live.

168. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
If a man sets out to study all the laws, he will have no time left to
transgress them.

169. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Things that are mysterious are not yet miracles.

170. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  'Converts are not in my good books.'

171. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
A frivolous impulsive encouragement of problematical talents was a
mistake of my early years; and I have never been able to abandon it
altogether.

172. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
I should like to be honest with you, without our falling out; but it
will not do. You act wrongly, and fall between two stools; you win no
adherents and lose your friends. What is to be the end of it?

173. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  It is all one whether you are of high or of humble origin.
  You will always have to pay for your humanity.

174. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
When I hear people speak of liberal ideas, it is always a wonder to me
that men are so readily put off with empty verbiage. An idea cannot be
liberal; but it may be potent, vigorous, exclusive, in order to fulfil
its mission of being productive. Still less can a concept be liberal;
for a concept has quite another mission. Where, however, we must look
for liberality, is in the sentiments; and the sentiments are the inner
man as he lives and moves. A man's sentiments, however, are rarely
liberal, because they proceed directly from him personally, and from his
immediate relations and requirements. Further we will not write, and let
us apply this test to what we hear every day.

175. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  If a clever man commits a folly, it is not a small one.

176. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
There is a poetry without figures of speech, which is a single figure of
speech.

177. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
I went on troubling myself about general ideas until I learnt to
understand the particular achievements of the best men.

178. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
It is only when a man knows little, that he knows anything at all. With
knowledge grows doubt.

179. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  The errors of a man are what make him really lovable.

180. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
There are men who love their like and seek it; others love their
opposite and follow after it.

181. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
If a man has always let himself think the world as bad as the adversary
represents it to be, he must have become a miserable person.

182. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Ill-favour and hatred limit the spectator to the surface, even when keen
perception is added unto them; but when keen perception unites with
good-will and love, it gets at the heart of man and the world; nay, it
may hope to reach the highest goal of all.

183. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Raw matter is seen by every one; the contents are found only by him who
has his eyes about him; and the form is a secret to the majority.

184. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
We may learn to know the world as we please: it will always retain a
bright and a dark side.

185. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Error is continually repeating itself in action, and we must unweariedly
repeat the truth in word.

186. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
As in Rome there is, apart from the Romans, a population of statues, so
apart from this real world there is a world of illusion, almost more
potent, in which most men live.

187. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Mankind is like the Red Sea: the staff has scarcely parted the waves
asunder, before they flow together again.

188. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Thoughts come back; beliefs persist; facts pass by never to return.

189. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Of all peoples, the Greeks have dreamt the dream of life the best.

190. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  We readily bow to antiquity, but not to posterity.
  It is only a father that does not grudge talent to his son.

191. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
There is no virtue in subordinating oneself; but there is virtue in
descending, and in recognising anything as above us, which is beneath us.

192. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  The whole art of living consists in giving up existence in order to exist.

193. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
All our pursuits and actions are a wearying process. Well is it for him
who wearies not.

194. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Hope is the second soul of the unhappy.

195. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Love is a true renovator.

196. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Mankind is not without a wish to serve;
  hence the chivalry of the French is a servitude.

197. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  In the theatre the pleasure of what we see and hear
  restrains our reflections.

198. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
There is no limit to the increase of experience, but theories cannot
become clearer and more complete in just the same sense. The field of
experience is the whole universe in all directions. Theory remains shut
up within the limits of the human faculties. Hence there is no way of
looking at the world, but it recurs, and the curious thing happens, that
with increased experience a limited theory may again come into favour.

It is always the same world which stands open to observation, which is
continually being contemplated or guessed at; and it is always the same
men who live in the true or in the false; more at their ease in the
latter than in the former.

199. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Truth is at variance with our natures, but not so error; and for a very
simple reason. Truth requires us to recognise ourselves as limited, but
error flatters us with the belief that in one way or another we are
subject to no bounds at all.

200. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
That some men think they can still do what they have been able to do, is
natural enough; that others think they can do what they have never been
able to do, is singular, but not rare.

201. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
At all times it has not been the age, but individuals alone, who have
worked for knowledge. It was the age which put Socrates to death by
poison, the age which burnt Huss. The ages have always remained alike.

202. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
That is true Symbolism, where the more particular represents the more
general, not as a dream or shade, but as a vivid, instantaneous
revelation of the Inscrutable.

203. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Everything of an abstract or symbolic nature, as soon as it is
challenged by realities, ends by consuming them and itself. So credit
consumes both money and itself.

204. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Mastery often passes for egoism.

205. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
With Protestants, as soon as good works cease and their merit is denied,
sentimentality takes their place.

206. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
If a man knows where to get good advice, it is as though he could supply
it himself.

207. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
The use of mottoes is to indicate something we have not attained, but
strive to attain. It is right to keep them always before our eyes.

208. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
'If a man cannot lift a stone himself, let him leave it, even though he
has some one to help him.'

209. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Despotism promotes general self-government, because from top to bottom
it makes the individual responsible, and so produces the highest degree
of activity.

210. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
A man must pay dear for his errors if he wishes to get rid of them, and
even then he is lucky.

211. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Enthusiasm is of the greatest value, so long as we are not carried away
by it.

212. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  School itself is the only true preparation for it.

213. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Error is related to truth as sleep to waking. I have observed that on
awakening from error a man turns again to truth as with new vigour.

214. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Every one suffers who does not work for himself. A man works for others
to have them share in his joy.

215. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Men's prejudices rest upon their character for the time being and cannot
be overcome, as being part and parcel of themselves. Neither evidence
nor common-sense nor reason has the slightest influence upon them.

216. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Characters often make a law of their failings. Men who know the world
have said that when prudence is only fear in disguise, its scruples
cannot be conquered. The weak often have revolutionary sentiments; they
think they would be well off if they were not ruled, and fail to
perceive that they can rule neither themselves nor others.

217. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Common-sense is born pure in the healthy man, is self-developed, and is
revealed by a resolute perception and recognition of what is necessary
and useful. Practical men and women avail themselves of it with
confidence. Where it is absent, both sexes find anything necessary when
they desire it, and useful when it gives them pleasure.

218. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
All men, as they attain freedom, give play to their errors. The strong
do too much, and the weak too little.

219. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
The conflict of the old, the existing, the continuing, with development,
improvement, and reform, is always the same. Order of every kind turns
at last to pedantry, and to get rid of the one, people destroy the
other; and so it goes on for a while, until people perceive that order
must be established anew. Classicism and Romanticism; close corporations
and freedom of trade; the maintenance of large estates and the division
of the land,--it is always the same conflict which ends by producing a
new one. The best policy of those in power would be so to moderate this
conflict as to let it right itself without the destruction of either
element. But this has not been granted to men, and it seems not to be
the will of God.

220. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
A great work limits us for the moment, because we feel it above our
powers; and only in so far as we afterwards incorporate it with our
culture, and make it part of our mind and heart, does it become a dear
and worthy object.

221. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
It is no wonder that we all more or less delight in the mediocre,
because it leaves us in peace: it gives us the comfortable feeling of
intercourse with what is like ourselves.

222. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  There is no use in reproving vulgarity, for it never changes.

223. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
We cannot escape a contradiction in ourselves; we must try to resolve
it. If the contradiction comes from others, it does not affect us: it is
their affair.

224. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  There are many things in the world that are at once good and excellent,
  but they do not come into contact.

225. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Which is the best government? That which teaches us to govern ourselves.

226. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  When men have to do with women, they get spun off like a distaff.

227. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
It may well be that a man is at times horribly threshed by misfortunes,
public and private: but the reckless flail of Fate, when it beats the
rich sheaves, crushes only the straw; and the corn feels nothing of it
and dances merrily on the floor, careless whether its way is to the mill
or the furrow.

228. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
However probable it is that a desire may be fulfilled, there is always a
doubt; and so when the desire is realised, it is always surprising.

229. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Absurdities presented with good taste rouse disgust and admiration.

230. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Of the best society it used to be said: their speech instructs the mind,
  and their silence the feelings.

231. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Nothing is more terrible than ignorance in action.

232. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  Beauty and Genius must be kept afar if one would avoid becoming their slave.

233. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  We treat the aged with consideration, as we treat children.

234. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
  An old man loses one of the greatest of human privileges:
  he is no more judged by his peers.

235. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
In the matter of knowledge, it has happened to me as to one who rises
early, and in the dark impatiently awaits the dawn, and then the sun;
but is blinded when it appears.

236. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections III
Great primeval powers, evolved in time or in eternity, work on
unceasingly: whether to weal or to woe, is a matter of chance.

237. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
People often say to themselves in life that they should avoid a variety
of occupation, and, more particularly, be the less willing to enter upon
new work the older they grow. But it is easy to talk, easy to give
advice to oneself and others. To grow old is itself to enter upon a new
business; all the circumstances change, and a man must either cease
acting altogether, or willingly and consciously take over the new rôle.

238. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
Of the Absolute in the theoretical sense, I do not venture to speak; but
this I maintain: that if a man recognises it in its manifestation, and
always keeps his gaze fixed upon it, he will experience very great
reward.

239. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
To live in a great idea means to treat the impossible as though it were
possible. It is just the same with a strong character; and when an idea
and a character meet, things arise which fill the world with wonder for
thousands of years.

240. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
Napoleon lived wholly in a great idea, but he was unable to take
conscious hold of it. After utterly disavowing all ideals and denying
them any reality, he zealously strove to realise them. His clear,
incorruptible intellect could not, however, tolerate such a perpetual
conflict within; and there is much value in the thoughts which he was
compelled, as it were, to utter, and which are expressed very peculiarly
and with much charm.

241. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
He considered the idea as a thing of the mind, that had, it is true, no
reality, but still, on passing away, left a residuum - a CAPUT MORTUUM -
to which some reality could not be altogether refused. We may
think this a very perverse and material notion; but when he entertained
his friends with the neverending consequences of his life and actions,
in full belief and confidence in them, he expressed himself quite
differently. Then, indeed, he was ready to admit that life produces
life; that a fruitful act has effects to all time. He took pleasure in
confessing that he had given a great impulse, a new direction, to the
course of the world's affairs.

242. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
It always remains a very remarkable fact that men whose whole
personality is almost all idea, are so extremely shy of all phantasy. In
this case was Hamann, who could not bear the mention of "things of
another world." He took occasion to express himself on this point in a
certain paragraph, which he wrote in fourteen different ways; and still,
apparently, he was never quite satisfied with it.

Two of these attempts have been preserved to us; a third we have
ourselves attempted, which we are induced to print here by the preceding
observations.

243. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
Man is placed as a real being in the midst of a real world, and endowed
with such organs that he can perceive and produce the real and also the
possible.

All healthy men have the conviction of their own existence and of an
existence around them. However, even the brain contains a hollow spot,
that is to say, a place in which no object is mirrored; just as in the
eye itself there is a little spot that does not see. If a man pays
particular attention to this spot and is absorbed in it, he falls into a
state of mental sickness, has presentiments of "things of another
world," which are, in reality, no things at all; possessing neither form
nor limit, but alarming him like dark, empty tracts of night, and
pursuing him as something more than phantoms, if he does not tear
himself free from them.

244. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
To the several perversities of the day a man should always oppose only
the great masses of universal history.

245. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
No one can live much with children without finding that they always
react to any outward influence upon them.

246. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
  With any specially childish nature the reaction is even passionate,
  while its action is energetic.

247. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
That is why children's lives are a series of refined judgments, not to
say prejudices; and to efface a rapid but partial perception in order to
make way for a more general one, time is necessary. To bear this in mind
is one of the teacher's greatest duties.

248. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections IV
Friendship can only be bred in practice and be maintained by practice.
Affection, nay, love itself, is no help at all to friendship. True,
active, productive friendship consists in keeping equal pace in life: in
my friend approving my aims, while I approve his, and in thus moving
forwards together steadfastly, however much our way of thought and life
may vary.

249. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
In the world people take a man at his own estimate; but he must estimate
himself at something. Disagreeableness is more easily tolerated than
insignificance.

250. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  You can force anything on society so long as it has no sequel.

251. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
We do not learn to know men if they come to us; we must go to them to
find out what they are.

252. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
That we have many criticisms to make on those who visit us, and that, as
soon as they depart, we pass no very amiable judgment upon them, seems
to me almost natural; for we have, so to speak, a right to measure them
by our own standard. Even intelligent and fair-minded men hardly refrain
from sharp censure on such occasions.

253. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
But if, on the contrary, we have been in their homes, and have seen them
in their surroundings and habits and the circumstances which are
necessary and inevitable for them; if we have seen the kind of influence
they exert on those around them, or how they behave, it is only
ignorance and ill-will that can find food for ridicule in what must
appear to us in more than one sense worthy of respect.

254. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
What we call conduct and good manners obtains for us that which
otherwise is to be obtained only by force, or not even by force.

255. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  Women's society is the element of good manners.

256. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
How can the character, the peculiar nature of a man, be compatible with
good manners?

257. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
It is through his good manners that a man's peculiar nature should be
made all the more conspicuous. Every one likes distinction, but it
should not be disagreeable.

258. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
The most privileged position, in life as in society, is that of an
educated soldier. Rough warriors, at any rate, remain true to their
character, and as great strength is usually the cover for good nature,
we get on with them at need.

259. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
No one is more troublesome than an awkward civilian. As his business is
not with anything brutal or coarse, he might be expected to show
delicacy of feeling.

260. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  When we live with people who have a delicate sense of what is fitting,
  we get quite anxious about them if anything happens to disturb this sense.

261. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
No one would come into a room with spectacles on his nose, if he knew
that women at once lose any inclination to look at or talk to him.

262. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  A familiar in the place of a respectful demeanour is always ridiculous.

263. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
There is no outward sign of politeness that will be found to lack some
deep moral foundation. The right kind of education would be that which
conveyed the sign and the foundation at the same time.

264. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  A man's manners are the mirror in which he shows his portrait.

265. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  There is a politeness of the heart, and it is allied to love.
  It produces the most agreeable politeness of outward demeanour.

266. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
Voluntary dependence is the best state, and how should that be possible
without love?

267. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
We are never further from our wishes than when we fancy we possess the
object of them.

268. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  No one is more of a slave than he who thinks himself free without being so.

269. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
A man has only to declare himself free to feel at the same moment that
he is limited. Should he venture to declare himself limited, he feels
himself free.

270. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  Against the great superiority of another there is no remedy but love.

271. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  It is a terrible thing for an eminent man to be gloried in by fools.

272. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
It is said that no man is a hero to his valet. That is only because a
hero can be recognised only by a hero. The valet will probably know how
to appreciate his like,--his fellow-valet.

273. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
There is no greater consolation for mediocrity than that the genius is
not immortal.

274. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  The greatest men are linked to their age by some weak point.

275. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  We generally take men to be more dangerous than they are.

276. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
Fools and wise folk are alike harmless. It is the half-wise, and the
half-foolish, who are the most dangerous.

277. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
To see a difficult thing lightly handled gives us the impression of the
impossible.

278. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  Difficulties increase the nearer we come to our aim.

279. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  Sowing is not so painful as reaping.

280. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
We are fond of looking to the future, because our secret wishes make us
apt to turn in our favour the uncertainties which move about in it
hither and thither.

281. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
It is not easy to be in any great assembly without thinking that the
chance which brings so many people together will also make us meet our
friends.

282. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
A man may live never so retired a life but he becomes a debtor or a
creditor before he is aware of it.

283. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
If anyone meets us who owes us a debt of gratitude, it immediately
crosses our mind. How often can we meet some one to whom we owe
gratitude, without thinking of it!

284. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
To communicate oneself is Nature; to receive a communication as it is
given is Culture.

285. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
No one would speak much in society if he were aware how often we
misunderstand others.

286. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
It is only because we have not understood a thing that we cannot repeat
it without alteration.

287. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
To make a long speech in the presence of others without flattering your
audience, is to rouse dislike.

288. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  Every word that we utter rouses its contrary.

289. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  Contradiction and flattery make, both of them, bad conversation.

290. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
The pleasantest society is that in which there exists a genial deference
amongst the members one towards another.

291. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
By nothing do men show their character more than by the things they
laugh at.

292. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
The ridiculous springs from a moral contrast innocently presented to the
senses.

293. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
The sensual man often laughs when there is nothing to laugh at. Whatever
it is that moves him, he shows that he is pleased with himself.

294. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
An intelligent man finds almost everything ridiculous, a wise man hardly
anything.

295. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
A man well on in years was reproved for still troubling himself about
young women. 'It is the only means,' he replied, 'of regaining one's
youth; and that is something every one wishes to do.'

296. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
A man does not mind being blamed for his faults, and being punished for
them, and he patiently suffers much for the sake of them; but he becomes
impatient if he is required to give them up.

297. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
Certain faults are necessary to the individual if he is to exist. We
should not like old friends to give up certain peculiarities.

298. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
It is said of a man that he will soon die, when he acts in any way
unlike himself.

299. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
What kind of faults in ourselves should we retain, nay, even cultivate?
Those which rather flatter other people than offend them.

300. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
  The passions are good or bad qualities, only intensified.

301. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
Our passions are, in truth, like the phoenix. When the old one burns
away, the new one rises out of its ashes at once.

302. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
Great passions are hopeless diseases. That which could cure them is the
first thing to make them really dangerous.

303. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
Passion is enhanced and tempered by avowal. In nothing, perhaps, is the
middle course more desirable than in confidence and reticence towards
those we love.

304. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
To sit in judgment on the departed is never likely to be equitable. We
all suffer from life; who except God can call us to account? Let not
their faults and sufferings, but what they have accomplished and done,
occupy the survivors.

305. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections V
It is failings that show human nature, and merits that distinguish the
individual; faults and misfortunes we all have in common; virtues belong
to each one separately.

306. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  The secret places in the way of life may not and cannot be revealed:
  there are rocks of offence on which every traveller must stumble.
  But the poet points to where they are.

307. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
It would not be worth while to see seventy years if all the wisdom of
this world were foolishness with God.

308. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
The true is Godlike: we do not see it itself; we must guess at it
through its manifestations.

309. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  The real scholar learns how to evolve the unknown from the known,
  and draws near the master.

310. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
In the smithy the iron is softened by blowing up the fire, and taking
the dross from the bar. As soon as it is purified, it is beaten and
pressed, and becomes firm again by the addition of fresh water. The same
thing happens to a man at the hands of his teacher.

311. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  What belongs to a man, he cannot get rid of, even though he throws it away.

312. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
Of true religions there are only two: one of them recognises and
worships the Holy that without form or shape dwells in and around us;
and the other recognises and worships it in its fairest form. Everything
that lies between these two is idolatry.

313. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
It is undeniable that in the Reformation the human mind tried to free
itself; and the renaissance of Greek and Roman antiquity brought about
the wish and longing for a freer, more seemly, and elegant life. The
movement was favoured in no small degree by the fact that men's hearts
aimed at returning to a certain simple state of nature, while the
imagination sought to concentrate itself.

314. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
The Saints were all at once driven from heaven; and senses, thought, and
heart were turned from a divine mother with a tender child, to the grown
man doing good and suffering evil, who was later transfigured into a
being half-divine in its nature, and then recognised and honoured as God
himself. He stood against a background where the Creator had opened out
the universe; a spiritual influence went out from him; his sufferings
were adopted as an example, and his transfiguration was the pledge of
everlastingness.

315. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  As a coal is revived by incense, so prayer revives the hopes of the heart.

316. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
From a strict point of view we must have a reformation of ourselves
every day, and protest against others, even though it be in no religious
sense.

317. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
It should be our earnest endeavour to use words coinciding as closely as
possible with what we feel, see, think, experience, imagine, and reason.
It is an endeavour which we cannot evade, and which is daily to be
renewed.

Let every man examine himself, and he will find this a much harder task
than he might suppose; for, unhappily, a man usually takes words as mere
make-shifts; his knowledge and his thought are in most cases better
than his method of expression.

False, irrelevant, and futile ideas may arise in ourselves and others,
or find their way into us from without. Let us persist in the effort to
remove them as far as we can, by plain and honest purpose.

318. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  As we grow older, the ordeals grow greater.

319. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  Where I cannot be moral, my power is gone.

320. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  A man is not deceived by others, he deceives himself.

321. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  Laws are all made by old people and by men.
  Youths and women want the exceptions, old people the rules.

322. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  It is not the intelligent man who rules, but intelligence;
  not the wise man, but wisdom.

323. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  To praise a man is to put oneself on his level.

324. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
It is not enough to know, we must also apply; it is not enough to will,
we must also do.

325. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
Chinese, Indian, and Egyptian antiquities are never more than
curiosities; it is well to make acquaintance with them; but in point of
moral and æsthetic culture they can help us little.

326. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
The German runs no greater danger than to advance with and by the
example of his neighbours. There is perhaps no nation that is fitter for
the process of self-development; so that it has proved of the greatest
advantage to Germany to have obtained the notice of the world so late.

327. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
Even men of insight do not see that they try to explain things which lie
at the foundation of our experience, and in which we must simply
acquiesce.

Yet still the attempt may have its advantage, as otherwise we should
break off our researches too soon.

328. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
From this time forward, if a man does not apply himself to some art or
handiwork, he will be in a bad way. In the rapid changes of the world,
knowledge is no longer a furtherance; by the time a man has taken note
of everything, he has lost himself.

329. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
Besides, in these days the world forces universal culture upon us, and
so we need not trouble ourselves further about it; we must appropriate
some particular culture.

330. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  The greatest difficulties lie where we do not look for them.

331. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  Our interest in public events is mostly the merest philistinism.

332. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  Nothing is more highly to be prized than the value of each day.

333. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  "Pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt!" This is so strange an utterance,
  that it could only have come from one who fancied himself autochthonous.
  The man who looks upon it as an honour to be descended from wise ancestors,
  will allow them at least as much common-sense as he allows himself.

334. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
  Strictly speaking, everything depends upon a man's intentions;
  where these exist, thoughts appear;
  and as the intentions are, so are the thoughts.

335. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VI
If a man lives long in a high position, he does not, it is true,
experience all that a man can experience; but he experiences things like
them, and perhaps some things that have no parallel elsewhere.


336. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The first and last thing that is required of genius is love of truth.

337. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
To be and remain true to oneself and others, is to possess the noblest
attribute of the greatest talents.

338. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Great talents are the best means of conciliation.

339. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The action of genius is in a way ubiquitous: towards general truths
before experience, and towards particular truths after it.

340. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
An active scepticism is one which constantly aims at overcoming itself,
and arriVIIng by means of regulated experience at a kind of conditioned
certainty.

341. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The general nature of the sceptical mind is its tendency to inquire
whether any particular predicate really attaches to any particular
object; and the purpose of the inquiry is safely to apply in practice
what has thus been discovered and proved.

342. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The mind endowed with active powers and keeping with a practical object
to the task that lies nearest, is the worthiest there is on earth.

343. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Perfection is the measure of heaven, and the wish to be perfect the
measure of man.

344. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Not only what is born with him, but also what he acquires, makes the man.

345. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
A man is well equipped for all the real necessities of life if he trusts
his senses, and so cultivates them that they remain worthy of being
trusted.

346. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The senses do not deceive; it is the judgment that deceives.

347. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The lower animal is taught by its organs; man teaches his organs, and
dominates them.

348. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
All direct inVIItation to live up to ideals is of doubtful value,
particularly if addressed to women. Whatever the reason of it may be, a
man of any importance collects round him a seraglio of a more or less
religious, moral, and æsthetic character.

349. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When a great idea enters the world as a Gospel, it becomes an offence to
the multitude, which stagnates in pedantry; and to those who have much
learning but little depth, it is folly.

350. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Every idea appears at first as a strange VIIsitor, and when it begins to
be realised, it is hardly distinguishable from phantasy and phantastery.

351. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
This it is that has been called, in a good and in a bad sense, ideology;
and this is why the ideologist is so repugnant to the hard-working,
practical man of every day.

352. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
You may recognise the utility of an idea, and yet not quite understand
how to make a perfect use of it.

353. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
"Credo Deum!" That is a fine, a worthy thing to say; but to recognise
God where and as he reveals himself, is the only true bliss on earth.

354. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Kepler said: 'My wish is that I may perceive the God whom I find
everywhere in the external world, in like manner also within and inside
me.' The good man was not aware that in that very moment the diVIIne in
him stood in the closest connection with the diVIIne in the Universe.

355. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
What is predestination? It is this: God is mightier and wiser than we
are, and so he does with us as he pleases.

356. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Toleration should, strictly speaking, be only a passing mood; it ought
to lead to acknowledgment and appreciation. To tolerate a person is to
affront him.

357. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Faith, Love, and Hope once felt, in a quiet sociable hour, a plastic
impulse in their nature; they worked together and created a lovely
image, a Pandora in the higher sense, Patience.

358. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  "I stumbled over the roots of the tree which I planted." 
  It must have been an old forester who said that.

359. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  A leaf blown by the wind often looks like a bird.

360. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Does the sparrow know how the stork feels?

361. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Lamps make oil-spots, and candles want snuffing; it is only the light of
heaven that shines pure and leaves no stain.

362. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If you miss the first button-hole, you will not succeed in buttoning up
your coat.

363. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
A burnt child dreads the fire; an old man who has often been singed is
afraid of warming himself.

364. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is not worth while to do anything for the world that we have with us,
as the existing order may in a moment pass away. It is for the past and
the future that we must work: for the past, to acknowledge its merits;
for the future, to try to increase its value.

365. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Let every man ask himself with which of his faculties he can and will
somehow influence his age.

366. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Let no one think that people have waited for him as for the SaVIIour.

367. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Character in matters great and small consists in a man steadily pursuing
the things of which he feels himself capable.

368. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The man who wants to be active and has to be so, need only think of what
is fitting at the moment, and he will make his way without difficulty.
This is where women have the advantage, if they understand it.

369. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The moment is a kind of public; a man must deceive it into belieVIIng
that he is doing something; then it leaves us alone to go our way in
secret; whereat its grandchildren cannot fail to be astonished.

370. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  There are men who put their knowledge in the place of insight.

371. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In some states, as a consequence of the VIIolent movements experienced in
almost all directions, there has come about a certain overpressure in
the system of education, the harm of which will be more generally felt
hereafter; though even now it is perfectly well recognised by capable
and honest authorities. Capable men live in a sort of despair over the
fact that they are bound by the rules of their office to teach and
communicate things which they look upon as useless and hurtful.

372. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There is no sadder sight than the direct striVIIng after the
unconditioned in this thoroughly conditioned world.

373. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Before the Revolution it was all EFFORT;
  afterwards it all changed to DEMAND.

374. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Can a nation become ripe? That is a strange question. I would answer,
Yes! if all the men could be born thirty years of age. But as youth will
always be too forward and old age too backward, the really mature man is
always hemmed in between them, and has to resort to strange deVIIces to
make his way through.

375. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It does not look well for monarchs to speak through the press, for power
should act and not talk. The projects of the liberal party always bear
being read: the man who is overpowered may at least express his VIIews in
speech, because he cannot act. When Mazarin was shown some satirical
songs on a new tax, 'Let them sing,' said he, 'as long as they pay.'

376. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Vanity is a desire of personal glory, the wish to be appreciated,
honoured, and run after, not because of one's personal qualities,
merits, and achievements, but because of one's indiVIIdual existence. At
best, therefore, it is a frivolous beauty whom it befits.

377. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The most important matters of feeling as of reason, of experience as of
reflection, should be treated of only by word of mouth. The spoken word
at once dies if it is not kept alive by some other word following on it
and suited to the hearer. Observe what happens in social converse. If
the word is not dead when it reaches the hearer, he murders it at once
by a contradiction, a stipulation, a condition, a digression, an
interruption, and all the thousand tricks of conversation. With the
written word the case is still worse. No one cares to read anything to
which he is not already to some extent accustomed: he demands the known
and the familiar under an altered form. Still the written word has this
advantage, that it lasts and can await the time when it is allowed to
take effect.

378. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Both what is reasonable and what is unreasonable have to undergo the
like contradiction.

379. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Dialectic is the culture of the spirit of contradiction, which is given
to man that he may learn to perceive the differences between things.

380. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
With those who are really of like disposition with himself a man cannot
long be at variance; he will always come to an agreement again. With
those who are really of adverse disposition, he may in vain try to
preserve harmony; he will always come to a separation again.

381. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Opponents fancy they refute us when they repeat their own opinion and
pay no attention to ours.

382. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
People who contradict and dispute should now and then remember that not
every mode of speech is intelligible to every one.

383. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Every man hears only what he understands.

384. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
I am quite prepared to find that many a reader will disagree with me;
but when he has a thing before him in black and white, he must let it
stand. Another reader may perhaps take up the very same copy and agree
with me.

385. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The truest liberality is appreciation.

386. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
For the strenuous man the difficulty is to recognise the merits of elder
contemporaries and not let himself be hindered by their defects.

387. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Some men think about the defects of their friends, and there is nothing
to be gained by it. I have always paid attention to the merits of my
enemies, and found it an advantage.

388. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  There are many men who fancy they understand whatever they experience.

389. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The public must be treated like women: they must be told absolutely
nothing but what they like to hear.

390. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Every age of man has a certain philosophy answering to it. The child
comes out as a realist: he finds himself as conVIInced that pears and
apples exist as that he himself exists. The youth in a storm of inner
passion is forced to turn his gaze within, and feel in advance what he
is going to be: he is changed into an idealist. But the man has every
reason to become a sceptic: he does well to doubt whether the means he
has chosen to his end are the right ones. Before and during action he
has every reason for keeping his understanding mobile, that he may not
afterwards have to grieve over a false choice. Yet when he grows old he
will always confess himself a mystic: he sees that so much seems to
depend on chance; that folly succeeds and wisdom fails; that good and
eVIIl fortune are brought unexpectedly to the same level; so it is and so
it has been, and old age acquiesces in that which is and was and will
be.

391. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  When a man grows old he must consciously remain at a certain stage.

392. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It does not become an old man to run after the fashion, either in
thought or in dress. But he must know where he is, and what the others
are aiming at.

What is called fashion is the tradition of the moment. All tradition
carries with it a certain necessity for people to put themselves on a
level with it.

393. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
We have long been busy with the critique of reason. I should like to see
a critique of common-sense. It would be a real benefit to mankind if we
could conVIIncingly prove to the ordinary intelligence how far it can go;
and that is just as much as it fully requires for life on this earth.

394. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The thinker makes a great mistake when he asks after cause and effect:
they both together make up the indiVIIsible phenomenon.

395. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
All practical men try to bring the world under their hands; all
thinkers, under their heads. How far each succeeds, they may both see
for themselves.

396. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Shall we say that a man thinks only when he cannot think out that of
which he is thinking?

397. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
What is invention or discovery? It is the conclusion of what we were
looking for.

398. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is with history as with nature and with everything of any depth, it
may be past, present, or future: the further we seriously pursue it, the
more difficult are the problems that appear. The man who is not afraid
of them, but attacks them bravely, has a feeling of higher culture and
greater ease the further he progresses.

399. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Every phenomenon is within our reach if we treat it as an inclined
plane, which is of easy ascent, though the thick end of the wedge may be
steep and inaccessible.

400. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If a man would enter upon some course of knowledge, he must either be
deceived or deceive himself, unless external necessity irresistibly
determines him. Who would become a physician if, at one and the same
time, he saw before him all the horrible sights that await him?

401. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
How many years must a man do nothing before he can at all know what is
to be done and how to do it!

402. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Duty: where a man loves what he commands himself to do.


403. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
LITERATURE AND ART
When Madame Roland was on the scaffold, she asked for pen and paper, to
note the peculiar thoughts that hovered about her on the last journey.
It is a pity they were refused, for in a tranquil mind thoughts rise up
at the close of life hitherto unthinkable; like blessed inward voices,
alighting in glory on the summits of the past.

404. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
LITERATURE AND ART
Literature is a fragment of fragments: the least of what happened and
was spoken, has been written; and of the things that have been written,
very few have been preserved.

405. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
LITERATURE AND ART
And yet, with all the fragmentary nature of literature, we find thousand
fold repetition; which shows how limited is man's mind and destiny.

406. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Excellent work is unfathomable, approach it as you will.

407. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is not language in itself which is correct or forcible or elegant,
but the mind that is embodied in it; and so it is not for a man to
determine whether he will give his calculations or speeches or poems the
desired qualities: the question is whether Nature has given him the
intellectual and moral qualities which fit him for the work,--the
intellectual power of observation and insight, the moral power of
repelling the eVIIl spirits that might hinder him from paying respect to
truth.

408. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The appeal to posterity springs from the pure, strong feeling of the
existence of something imperishable; something that, even though it be
not at once recognised, will in the end be gratified by finding the
minority turn into a majority.

409. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When a new literature succeeds, it obscures the effect of an earlier
one, and its own effect predominates; so that it is well, from time to
time, to look back. What is original in us is best preserved and
quickened if we do not lose sight of those who have gone before us.

410. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The most original authors of modern times are so, not because they
produce what is new, but only because they are able to say things the
like of which seem never to have been said before.

411. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Thus the best sign of originality lies in taking up a subject and then
developing it so fully as to make every one confess that he would hardly
have found so much in it.

412. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There are many thoughts that come only from general culture, like buds
from green branches. When roses bloom, you see them blooming everywhere.

413. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Lucidity is a due distribution of light and shade. (Hamann).

414. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  A man who has no acquaintance with foreign languages
  knows nothing of his own.

415. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  We must remember that there are many men who, without being productive,
  are anxious to say something important, and the results are most curious.

416. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Deep and earnest thinkers are in a difficult position with regard to the
public.

417. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Some books seem to have been written, not to teach us anything, but to
let us know that the author has known something.

418. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
An author can show no greater respect for his public than by never
bringing it what it expects, but what he himself thinks right and proper
in that stage of his own and others' culture in which for the time he
finds himself.

419. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The so-called Nature-poets are men of active talent, with a fresh
stimulus and reaction from an over-cultured, stagnant, mannered epoch of
art. They cannot avoid commonplace.

420. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Productions are now possible which, without being bad, have no value.
They have no value, because they contain nothing; and they are not bad,
because a general form of good-workmanship is present to the author's
mind.

421. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  All lyrical work must, as a whole, be perfectly intelligible,
  but in some particulars a little unintelligible.

422. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
A romance is a subjective epic in which the author begs leave to treat
the world after his own ideas. The only question is, whether he has any
ideas; the rest will follow of itself.

423. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Subjective or so-called sentimental poetry has now been admitted to an
equality with objective and descriptive. This was ineVIItable; because
otherwise the whole of modern poetry would have to be discarded. It is
now obVIIous that when men of truly poetical genius appear, they will
describe more of the particular feelings of the inner life than of the
general facts of the great life of the world. This has already taken
place to such a degree that we have a poetry without figures of speech,
which can by no means be refused all praise.

424. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Superstition is the poetry of life, and so it does not hurt the poet to
be superstitious.

425. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
That glorious hymn, "Veni Creator Spiritus", is really an appeal to
genius. That is why it speaks so powerfully to men of intellect and power.

426. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Translators are like busy match-makers: they sing the praises of some
half-veiled beauty, and extol her charms, and arouse an irresistible
longing for the original.

427. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  A Spinoza in poetry becomes a Machiavelli in philosophy.

428. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Against the three unities there is nothing to be said, if the subject is
very simple; but there are times when thrice three unities, skilfully
interwoven, produce a very pleasant effect.

429. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The sentimentality of the English is humorous and tender; of the French,
popular and pathetic; of the Germans, naïve and realistic.

430. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Mysticism is the scholastic of the heart, the dialectic of the feelings.

431. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If a man sets out to reproach an author with obscurity, he should first
of all examine his own mind, to see if he is himself all clearness
within. Twilight makes even plain writing illegible.

432. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is with books as with new acquaintances. At first we are highly
delighted, if we find a general agreement,--if we are pleasantly moved
on any of the chief sides of our existence. With a closer acquaintance
differences come to light; and then reasonable conduct mainly consists
in not shrinking back at once, as may happen in youth, but in keeping
firm hold of the things in which we agree, and being quite clear about
the things in which we differ, without on that account desiring any
union.

433. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In psychological reflection the greatest difficulty is this: that inner
and outer must always be VIIewed in parallel lines, or, rather,
interwoven. It is a continual systole and diastole, an inspiration and
an expiration of the liVIIng soul. If this cannot be put into words, it
should be carefully marked and noted.

434. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
My relations with Schiller rested on the decided tendency of both of us
towards a single aim, and our common actiVIIty rested on the diversity of
the means by which we endeavoured to attain that aim.

435. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Once when a slight difference was mentioned between us, of which I was
reminded by a passage in a letter of his, I made the following
Reflections VII: There is a great difference between a poet seeking the
particular for the universal, and seeing the universal in the
particular. The one gives rise to Allegory, where the particular serves
only as instance or example of the general; but the other is the true
nature of Poetry, namely, the expression of the particular without any
thought of, or reference to, the general. If a man grasps the particular
VIIVIIdly, he also grasps the general, without being aware of it at the
time; or he may make the discovery long afterwards.

436. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  There may be eclectic philosophers, but not an eclectic philosophy.

437. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
But every one is an eclectic who, out of the things that surround and
take place about him, appropriates what is suited to his nature; and
this is what is meant by culture and progress, in matters of theory or
practice.

438. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Various maxims of the ancients, which we are wont to repeat again and
again, had a meaning quite different from that which is apt to attach to
them in later times.

439. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The saying that no one who is unacquainted with or a stranger to
geometry should enter the philosopher's school, does not mean that a man
must become a mathematician to attain the wisdom of the world.

440. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Geometry is here taken in its primary elements, such as are contained in
Euclid and laid before every beginner; and then it is the most perfect
propædeutic and introduction to philosophy.

441. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When a boy begins to understand that an inVIIsible point must always come
before a VIIsible one, and that the shortest way between two points is a
straight line, before he can draw it on his paper with a pencil, he
experiences a certain pride and pleasure. And he is not wrong; for he
has the source of all thought opened to him; idea and reality, "potentia
"potentiaet actu", are become clear; the philosopher has no new discovery to
bring him; as a mathematician, he has found the basis of all thought for
himself.

442. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
And if we turn to that significant utterance, KNOW THYSELF, we must
not explain it in an ascetic sense. It is in nowise the self-knowledge
of our modern hypochondrists, humorists, and self-tormentors. It simply
means: pay some attention to yourself; take note of yourself; so that
you may know how you come to stand towards those like you and towards
the world. This involves no psychological torture; every capable man
knows and feels what it means. It is a piece of good adVIIce which every
one will find of the greatest advantage in practice.

443. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Let us remember how great the ancients were; and especially how the
Socratic school holds up to us the source and standard of all life and
action, and bids us not indulge in empty speculation, but live and do.

444. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
So long as our scholastic education takes us back to antiquity and
furthers the study of the Greek and Latin languages, we may congratulate
ourselves that these studies, so necessary for the higher culture, will
never disappear.

445. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If we set our gaze on antiquity and earnestly study it, in the desire to
form ourselves thereon, we get the feeling as if it were only then that
we really became men.

446. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The pedagogue, in trying to write and speak Latin, has a higher and
grander idea of himself than would be permissible in ordinary life.

447. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In the presence of antiquity, the mind that is susceptible to poetry and
art feels itself placed in the most pleasing ideal state of nature; and
even to this day the Homeric hymns have the power of freeing us, at any
rate, for moments, from the frightful burden which the tradition of
several thousand years has rolled upon us.

448. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There is no such thing as patriotic art and patriotic science. Both art
and science belong, like all things great and good, to the whole world,
and can be furthered only by a free and general interchange of ideas
among contemporaries, with continual reference to the heritage of the
past as it is known to us.

449. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Poetical talent is given to peasant as well as to knight; all that is
required is that each shall grasp his position and treat it worthily.

450. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
An historic sense means a sense so cultured that, in valuing the deserts
and merits of its own time, it takes account also of the past.

451. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The best that history gives us is the enthusiasm it arouses.

452. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The historian's duty is twofold: first towards himself, then towards his
readers. As regards himself, he must carefully examine into the things
that could have happened; and, for the reader's sake, he must determine
what actually did happen. His action towards himself is a matter between
himself and his colleagues; but the public must not see into the secret
that there is little in history which can be said to be positively
determined.

453. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The historian's duty is to separate the true from the false, the certain
from the uncertain, and the doubtful from that which cannot be accepted.

454. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is seldom that any one of great age becomes historical to himself,
and finds his contemporaries become historical to him, so that he
neither cares nor is able to argue with any one.

455. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
On a closer examination of the matter, it will be found that the
historian does not easily grasp history as something historical. In
whatever age he may live, the historian always writes as though he
himself had been present at the time of which he treats, instead of
simply narrating the facts and movements of that time. Even the mere
chronicler only points more or less to his own limitations, or the
peculiarities of his town or monastery or age.

456. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
We really learn only from those books which we cannot criticise. The
author of a book which we could criticise would have to learn from us.

457. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
That is the reason why the Bible will never lose its power; because, as
long as the world lasts, no one can stand up and say: I grasp it as a
whole and understand all the parts of it. But we say humbly: as a whole
it is worthy of respect, and in all its parts it is applicable.

458. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There is and will be much discussion as to the use and harm of
circulating the Bible. One thing is clear to me: mischief will result,
as heretofore, by using it phantastically as a system of dogma; benefit,
as heretofore, by a loVIIng acceptance of its teachings.

459. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
I am conVIInced that the Bible will always be more beautiful the more it
is understood; the more, that is, we see and observe that every word
which we take in a general sense and apply specially to ourselves, had,
under certain circumstances of time and place, a peculiar, special, and
directly indiVIIdual reference.

460. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The incurable eVIIl of religious controversy is that while one party
wants to connect the highest interest of humanity with fables and
phrases, the other tries to rest it on things that satisfy no one.

461. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If one has not read the newspapers for some months and then reads them
all together, one sees, as one never saw before, how much time is wasted
with this kind of literature.

462. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The classical is health; and the romantic, disease.

463. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
OVIId remained classical even in exile: it is not in himself that he sees
misfortune, but in his banishment from the metropolis of the world.

464. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The romantic is already fallen into its own abysm. It is hard to imagine
anything more degraded than the worst of the new productions.

465. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Bodies which rot while they are still alive, and are edified by the
detailed contemplation of their own decay; dead men who remain in the
world for the ruin of others, and feed their death on the liVIIng, -
to this have come our makers of literature.

When the same thing happened in antiquity, it was only as a strange
token of some rare disease; but with the moderns the disease has become
endemic and epidemic.

466. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Literature decays only as men become more and more corrupt.

467. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  What a day it is when we must envy the men in their graves!

468. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The things that are true, good, excellent, are simple and always alike,
whatever their appearance may be. But the error that we blame is
extremely manifold and varying; it is in conflict not only with the good
and the true, but also with itself; it is self-contradictory. Thus it is
that the words of blame in our literature must necessarily outnumber the
words of praise.

469. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The Greeks, whose poetry and rhetoric was of a simple and positive
character, express approval more often than disapproval. With the Latin
writers it is the contrary; and the more poetry and the arts of speech
decay, the more will blame swell and praise shrink.

470. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
'What are tragedies but the versified passions of people who make Heaven
knows what out of the external world?'

471. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There are certain empirical enthusiasts who are quite right in showing
their enthusiasm over new productions that are good; but they are as
ecstatic as if there were no other good work in the world at all.

472. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In Sakontala the poet appears in his highest function. As the
representative of the most natural condition of things, the finest mode
of life, the purest moral endeavour, the worthiest majesty, and the most
solemn worship, he ventures on common and ridiculous contrasts.

473. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Shakespeare's Henry IV. If everything were lost that has ever been
preserved to us of this kind of writing, the arts of poetry and rhetoric
could be completely restored out of this one play.

474. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Shakespeare's finest dramas are wanting here and there in facility: they
are something more than they should be, and for that very reason
indicate the great poet.

475. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Shakespeare is dangerous reading for budding talents: he compels them to
reproduce him, and they fancy they are producing themselves.

476. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Yorick Sterne was the finest spirit that ever worked. To read him is to
attain a fine feeling of freedom; his humour is inimitable, and it is
not every kind of humour that frees the soul.

477. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The peculiar value of so-called popular ballads is that their motives
are drawn direct from nature. This, however, is an advantage of which
the poet of culture could also avail himself, if he knew how to do it.

478. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
But in popular ballads there is always this advantage, that in the art
of saying things shortly uneducated men are always better skilled than
those who are in the strict sense of the word educated.

479. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Gemüth = Heart. The translator must proceed until he reaches the
untranslatable; and then only will he have an idea of the foreign nation
and the foreign tongue.

480. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When we say of a landscape that it has a romantic character, it is the
secret feeling of the sublime taking the form of the past, or, what is
the same thing, of solitude, absence, or seclusion.

481. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The Beautiful is a manifestation of secret laws of nature, which,
without its presence, would never have been revealed.

482. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is said: Artist, study nature! But it is no trifle to develop the
noble out of the commonplace, or beauty out of uniformity.

483. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When Nature begins to reveal her open secret to a man, he feels an
irresistible longing for her worthiest interpreter, Art.

484. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
For all other Arts we must make some allowance; but to Greek Art alone
we are always debtors.

485. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There is no surer way of evading the world than by Art; and no surer way
of uniting with it than by Art.

486. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Even in the moments of highest happiness and deepest misery we need the
Artist.

487. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
False tendencies of the senses are a kind of desire after realism,
always better than that false tendency which expresses itself as
idealistic longing.

488. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The dignity of Art appears perhaps most conspicuously in Music; for in
Music there is no material to be deducted. It is wholly form and
intrinsic value, and it raises and ennobles all that it expresses.

489. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is only by Art, and especially by Poetry, that the imagination is
regulated. Nothing is more frightful than imagination without taste.

490. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If we were to despise Art on the ground that it is an imitation of
Nature, it might be answered that Nature also imitates much else;
further, that Art does not exactly imitate that which can be seen by the
eyes, but goes back to that element of reason of which Nature consists
and according to which Nature acts.

491. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Further, the Arts also produce much out of themselves, and, on the other
hand, add much where Nature fails in perfection, in that they possess
beauty in themselves. So it was that Pheidias could sculpture a god
although he had nothing that could be seen by the eye to imitate, but
grasped the appearance which Zeus himself would have if he were to come
before our eyes.

492. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Art rests upon a kind of religious sense: it is deeply and ineradicably
in earnest. Thus it is that Art so willingly goes hand in hand with
Religion.

493. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
A noble philosopher spoke of architecture as FROZEN MUSIC; and it was
ineVIItable that many people should shake their heads over his remark. We
believe that no better repetition of this fine thought can be given than
by calling architecture a SPEECHLESS MUSIC.

494. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Art is essentially noble; therefore the artist has nothing to fear from
a low or common subject. Nay, by taking it up, he ennobles it; and so it
is that we see the greatest artists boldly exercising their sovereign
rights.

495. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In every artist there is a germ of daring, without which no talent is
conceivable.

496. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
All the artists who are already known to me from so many sides, I
propose to consider exclusively from the ethical side; to explain from
the subject-matter and method of their work the part played therein by
time and place, nation and master, and their own indestructible
personality; to mould them to what they became and to preserve them in
what they were.

497. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Art is a medium of what no tongue can utter; and thus it seems a piece
of folly to try to convey its meaning afresh by means of words. But, by
trying to do so, the understanding gains; and this, again, benefits the
faculty in practice.

498. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
An artist who produces valuable work is not always able to give an
account of his own or others' performances.

499. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
We know of no world except in relation to mankind; and we wish for no
Art that does not bear the mark of this relation.

500. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Higher aims are in themselves more valuable, even if unfulfilled,
  than lower ones quite attained.

501. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Blunt naïvety, stubborn VIIgour, scrupulous observance of rule, and any
other epithets which may apply to older German Art, are a part of every
earlier and simpler artistic method. The older Venetians, Florentines,
and others had it all too.

502. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Because Albrecht Dürer, with his incomparable talent, could never rise
to the idea of the symmetry of beauty, or even to the thought of a
fitting conformity to the object in VIIew, are we never to spurn the
ground!

503. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Albrecht Dürer had the advantage of a very profound realistic
perception, an affectionate human sympathy with all present conditions.
He was kept back by a gloomy phantasy, devoid both of form and
foundation.

504. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It would be interesting to show how Martin Schön stands near him, and
how the merits of German Art were restricted to these two; and useful
also to show that it was not evening every day.

505. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  In every Italian school the butterfly breaks loose from the chrysalis.

506. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
After Klopstock released us from rhyme, and Voss gave us models of
prose, are we to make doggerel again like Hans Sachs?

507. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Let us be many-sided! Turnips are good, but they are best mixed with
chestnuts. And these two noble products of the earth grow far apart.

508. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In every kind of Art there is a degree of excellence which may be
reached, so to speak, by the mere use of one's own natural talents. But
at the same time it is impossible to go beyond that point, unless Art
comes to one's aid.

509. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In the presence of Nature even moderate talent is always possessed of
insight; hence drawings from Nature that are at all carefully done
always give pleasure.

510. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
To make many sketches issue at last in a complete work is something that
not even the best artists always achieve.

511. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In the sphere of true Art there is no preparatory school, but there is a
way of preparation; and the best preparation is the interest of the most
insignificant pupil in the work of the master. Colour-grinders have
often made excellent painters.

512. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If an artist grasps Nature aright and contrives to give its form a
nobler, freer grace, no one will understand the source of his
inspiration, and every one will swear that he has taken it from the
antique.

513. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In studying the human form, let the painter reject what is exaggerated,
false, and mechanical; but let him learn to grasp of what infinite grace
the human body is capable.

514. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Kant taught us the critique of the reason. We must have a critique of
the senses if Art in general, and especially German Art, is ever to
regain its tone and move forward on the path of life and happiness.

515. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
SCIENCE
In the sphere of natural science let us remember that we have always to
deal with an insoluble problem. Let us prove keen and honest in
attending to anything which is in any way brought to our notice, most of
all when it does not fit in with our preVIIous ideas. For it is only
thereby that we perceive the problem, which does indeed lie in nature,
but still more in man.

516. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
SCIENCE
A man cannot well stand by himself, and so he is glad to join a party;
because if he does not find rest there, he at any rate finds quiet and
safety.

517. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
SCIENCE
It is a misfortune to pass at once from observation to conclusion, and
to regard both as of equal value; but it befalls many a student.

518. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In the history of science and throughout the whole course of its
progress we see certain epochs following one another more or less
rapidly. Some important VIIew is expressed, it may be original or only
reVIIved; sooner or later it receives recognition; fellow workers spring
up; the outcome of it finds its way into the schools; it is taught and
handed down; and we observe, unhappily, that it does not in the least
matter whether the VIIew be true or false. In either case its course is
the same; in either case it comes in the end to be a mere phrase, a
lifeless word stamped on the memory.

519. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  First let a man teach himself, and then he will be taught by others.

520. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Theories are usually the over-hasty efforts of an impatient
understanding that would gladly be rid of phenomena, and so puts in
their place pictures, notions, nay, often mere words. We may surmise, or
even see quite well, that such theories are make-shifts; but do not
passion and party-spirit love a make-shift at all times? And rightly,
too, because they stand in so much need of it.

521. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is difficult to know how to treat the errors of the age. If a man
oppose them, he stands alone; if he surrender to them, they bring him
neither joy nor credit.

522. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There are some hundred Christian sects, every one of them acknowledging
God and the Lord in its own way, without troubling themselves further
about one another. In the study of nature, nay, in every study, things
must of necessity come to the same pass. For what is the meaning of
every one speaking of toleration, and trying to prevent others from
thinking and expressing themselves after their own fashion?

523. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
To communicate knowledge by means of analogy appears to me a process
equally useful and pleasant. The analogous case is not there to force
itself on the attention or prove anything; it offers a comparison with
some other case, but is not in union with it. Several analogous cases do
not join to form a seried row: they are like good society, which always
suggests more than it grants.

524. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
To err is to be as though truth did not exist. To lay bare the error to
oneself and others is retrospective discovery.

525. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
With the growth of knowledge our ideas must from time to time be
organised afresh. The change takes place usually in accordance with new
maxims as they arise, but it always remains proVIIsional.

526. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When we find facts within our knowledge exhibited by some new method, or
even, it may be, described in a foreign language, they receive a
peculiar charm of novelty and wear a fresh air.

527. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If two masters of the same art differ in their statement of it, in all
likelihood the insoluble problem lies midway between them.

528. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The orbits of certainties touch one another; but in the interstices
there is room enough for error to go forth and prevail.

529. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
We more readily confess to errors, mistakes, and shortcomings in our
conduct than in our thought.

530. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
And the reason of it is that the conscience is humble and even takes a
pleasure in being ashamed. But the intellect is proud, and if forced to
recant is driven to despair.

531. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
This also explains how it is that truths which have been recognised are
at first tacitly admitted, and then gradually spread, so that the very
thing which was obstinately denied appears at last as something quite
natural.

532. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Ignorant people raise questions which were answered by the wise
thousands of years ago.

533. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When a man sees a phenomenon before him, his thoughts often range beyond
it; when he hears it only talked about, he has no thoughts at all.

534. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Authority. Man cannot exist without it, and yet it brings in its train
just as much of error as of truth. It perpetuates one by one things
which should pass away one by one; it rejects that which should be
preserved and allows it to pass away; and it is chiefly to blame for
mankind's want of progress.

535. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Authority--the fact, namely, that something has already happened or been
said or decided, is of great value; but it is only a pedant who demands
authority for everything.

536. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
An old foundation is worthy of all respect, but it must not take from us
the right to build afresh wherever we will.

537. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Our adVIIce is that every man should remain in the path he has struck out
for himself, and refuse to be overawed by authority, hampered by
prevalent opinion, or carried away by fashion.

538. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The various branches of knowledge always tend as a whole to stray away
from life, and return thither only by a roundabout way.

539. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
For they are, in truth, text-books of life: they gather outer and inner
experiences into a general and connected whole.

540. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
An important fact, an ingenious "aperçu", occupies a very great number
of men, at first only to make acquaintance with it; then to understand
it; and afterwards to work it out and carry it further.

541. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
On the appearance of anything new the mass of people ask: What is the
use of it? And they are not wrong. For it is only through the use of
anything that they can perceive its value.

542. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The truly wise ask what the thing is in itself and in relation to other
things, and do not trouble themselves about the use of it,--in other
words, about the way in which it may be applied to the necessities of
existence and what is already known. This will soon be discovered by
minds of a very different order--minds that feel the joy of liVIIng, and
are keen, adroit, and practical.

543. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Every investigator must before all things look upon himself as one who
is summoned to serve on a jury. He has only to consider how far the
statement of the case is complete and clearly set forth by the eVIIdence.
Then he draws his conclusion and gives his vote, whether it be that his
opinion coincides with that of the foreman or not.

544. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
And in acting thus he remains equally at ease whether the majority agree
with him or he finds himself in a minority. For he has done what he
could: he has expressed his conVIIctions; and he is not master of the
minds or hearts of others.

545. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In the world of science, however, these sentiments have never been of
much account. There everything depends on making opinion prevail and
dominate; few men are really independent; the majority draws the
indiVIIdual after it.

546. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The history of philosophy, of science, of religion, all shows that
opinions spread in masses, but that that always comes to the front which
is more easily grasped, that is to say, is most suited and agreeable to
the human mind in its ordinary condition. Nay, he who has practised
self-culture in the higher sense may always reckon upon meeting an
adverse majority.

547. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There is much that is true which does not admit of being calculated;
just as there are a great many things that cannot be brought to the test
of a decisive experiment.

548. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
It is just for this that man stands so high, that what could not
otherwise be brought to light should be brought to light in him.

What is a musical string, and all its mechanical diVIIsion, in comparison
with the musician's ear? May we not also say, what are the elementary
phenomena of nature itself compared with man, who must control and
modify them all before he can in any way assimilate them to himself?

549. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  To a new truth there is nothing more hurtful than an old error.

550. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The ultimate origin of things is completely beyond our faculties; hence
when we see anything come into being, we look upon it as haVIIng been
already there. This is why we find the theory of "emboîtement"
intelligible.

551. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There are many problems in natural science on which we cannot fittingly
speak unless we call metaphysics to our aid; but not the wisdom of the
schools, which consists in mere verbiage. It is that which was before
physics, exists with it, and will be after it.

552. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Since men are really interested in nothing but their own opinions, every
one who puts forward an opinion looks about him right and left for means
of strengthening himself and others in it. A man avails himself of the
truth so long as it is serVIIceable; but he seizes on what is false with
a passionate eloquence as soon as he can make a momentary use of it;
whether it be to dazzle others with it as a kind of half-truth, or to
employ it as a stopgap for effecting an apparent union between things
that have been disjointed. This experience at first caused me annoyance,
and then sorrow; and now it is a source of mischievous satisfaction. I
have pledged myself never again to expose a proceeding of this kind.

553. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Everything that we call Invention or Discovery in the higher sense of
the word is the serious exercise and actiVIIty of an original feeling for
truth, which, after a long course of silent cultivation, suddenly
flashes out into fruitful knowledge. It is a revelation working from
within on the outer world, and lets a man feel that he is made in the
image of God. It is a synthesis of World and Mind, giVIIng the most
blessed assurance of the eternal harmony of things.

554. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  A man must cling to the belief that the incomprehensible is comprehensible;
  otherwise he would not try to fathom it.

555. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  There are pedants who are also rascals, and they are the worst of all.

556. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
A man does not need to have seen or experienced everything himself. But
if he is to commit himself to another's experiences and his way of
putting them, let him consider that he has to do with three things--the
object in question and two subjects.

557. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The supreme achievement would be to see that stating a fact is starting
a theory.

558. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If I acquiesce at last in some ultimate fact of nature, it is, no doubt,
only resignation; but it makes a great difference whether the
resignation takes place at the limits of human faculty, or within the
hypothetical boundaries of my own narrow indiVIIduality.

559. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If we look at the problems raised by Aristotle, we are astonished at his
gift of observation. What wonderful eyes the Greeks had for many things!
Only they committed the mistake of being over-hasty, of passing
straightway from the phenomenon to the explanation of it, and thereby
produced certain theories that are quite inadequate. But this is the
mistake of all times, and still made in our own day.

560. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Hypotheses are cradle-songs by which the teacher lulls his scholars to
sleep. The thoughtful and honest observer is always learning more and
more of his limitations; he sees that the further knowledge spreads, the
more numerous are the problems that make their appearance.

561. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Our mistake is that we doubt what is certain and want to establish what
is uncertain. My maxim in the study of Nature is this: hold fast what is
certain and keep a watch on what is uncertain.

562. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  What a master a man would be in his own subject if he taught nothing useless!

563. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The greatest piece of folly is that every man thinks himself compelled
  to hand down what people think they have known.

564. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  If many a man did not feel obliged to repeat what is untrue,
  because he has said it once, the world would have been quite different.

565. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Every man looks at the world lying ready before him, ordered and
fashioned into a complete whole, as after all but an element out of
which his endeavour is to create a special world suited to himself.
Capable men lay hold of the world without hesitation and try to shape
their course as best they can; others dally over it, and some doubt even
of their own existence.

The man who felt the full force of this fundamental truth would dispute
with no one, but look upon another's mode of thought equally with his
own, as merely a phenomenon. For we find almost daily that one man can
think with ease what another cannot possibly think at all; and that,
too, not in matters which might have some sort of effect upon their
common weal or woe, but in things which cannot touch them at all.

566. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There is nothing more odious than the majority; it consists of a few
powerful men to lead the way; of accommodating rascals and submissive
weaklings; and of a mass of men who trot after them, without in the
least knowing their own mind.

567. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
When I observe the luminous progress and expansion of natural science in
modern times, I seem to myself like a traveller going eastwards at dawn,
and gazing at the growing light with joy, but also with impatience;
looking forward with longing to the advent of the full and final light,
but, nevertheless, haVIIng to turn away his eyes when the sun appeared,
unable to bear the splendour he had awaited with so much desire.

568. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
We praise the eighteenth century for concerning itself chiefly with
analysis. The task remaining to the nineteenth is to discover the false
syntheses which prevail, and to analyse their contents anew.

569. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
A school may be regarded as a single indiVIIdual who talks to himself for
a hundred years, and takes an extraordinary pleasure in his own being,
however foolish and silly it may be.

570. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
In science it is a serVIIce of the highest merit to seek out those
fragmentary truths attained by the ancients, and to develop them
further.

571. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
If a man devotes himself to the promotion of science, he is firstly
opposed, and then he is informed that his ground is already occupied. At
first men will allow no value to what we tell them, and then they behave
as if they knew it all themselves.

572. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Nature fills all space with her limitless productiVIIty. If we observe
merely our own earth, everything that we call eVIIl and unfortunate is so
because Nature cannot proVIIde room for everything that comes into
existence, and still less endow it with permanence.

573. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Everything that comes into being seeks room for itself and desires duration:
  hence it drives something else from its place and shortens its duration.

574. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There is so much of cryptogamy in phanerogamy that centuries will not
decipher it.

575. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  What a true saying it is that he who wants to deceive mankind
  must before all things make absurdity plausible.

576. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The further knowledge advances, the nearer we come to the unfathomable:
the more we know how to use our knowledge, the better we see that the
unfathomable is of no practical use.

577. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The finest achievement for a man of thought is to have fathomed what may
be fathomed, and quietly to revere the unfathomable.

578. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The discerning man who acknowledges his limitations
  is not far off perfection.

579. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
There are two things of which a man cannot be careful enough: of
obstinacy if he confines himself to his own line of thought; of
incompetency, if he goes beyond it.

580. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  Incompetency is a greater obstacle to perfection than one would think.

581. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The century advances; but every indiVIIdual begins anew.

582. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
What friends do with us and for us is a real part of our life; for it
strengthens and advances our personality. The assault of our enemies is
not part of our life; it is only part of our experience; we throw it off
and guard ourselves against it as against frost, storm, rain, hail, or
any other of the external eVIIls which may be expected to happen.

583. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
A man cannot live with every one, and therefore he cannot live for every
one. To see this truth aright is to place a high value upon one's
friends, and not to hate or persecute one's enemies. Nay, there is
hardly any greater advantage for a man to gain than to find out, if he
can, the merits of his opponents: it gives him a decided ascendency over
them.

584. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Every one knows how to value what he has attained in life; most of all
the man who thinks and reflects in his old age. He has a comfortable
feeling that it is something of which no one can rob him.

585. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  The best metempsychosis is for us to appear again in others.

586. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  It is very seldom that we satisfy ourselves;
  all the more consoling is it to have satisfied others.

587. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
We look back upon our life only as on a thing of broken pieces, because
our misses and failures are always the first to strike us, and outweigh
in our imagination what we have done, and attained.

588. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
The sympathetic youth sees nothing of this; he reads, enjoys, and uses
the youth of one who has gone before him, and rejoices in it with all
his heart, as though he had once been what he now is.

589. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
Science helps us before all things in this, that it somewhat lightens
the feeling of wonder with which Nature fills us; then, however, as life
becomes more and more complex, it creates new facilities for the
avoidance of what would do us harm and the promotion of what will do us
good.

590. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections VII
  It is always our eyes alone, our way of looking at things.
  Nature alone knows what she means now, and what she had meant in the past.

591. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections
NATURE: APHORISMS
  Nature! We are surrounded by her and locked in her clasp: 
  powerless to leave her, and powerless to come closer to her.
  Unasked and unwarned shetakes us up into the whirl of her dance,
  and hurries on with us till we are weary and fall from her arms.

591. Goethe, Maxims and Reflections
NATURE: APHORISMS
  Nature creates new forms without end: what exists now, never was before;
  what was, comes not again; all is new and yet always the old.

  We live in the midst of her and are strangers.
  She speaks to us unceasingly and betrays not her secret.
  We are always influencing her and yet can do her no VIIolence.
