#### Screensaver - Johann Wolfgang Goethe: Faust I+II Breviary

Customize your screen and copy `haScreenSav.SCR` into the `c:\windows\system32` folder.    
Select it as the current screensaver, and, in settings choose your personal flavour.    
*haScreenSav* will randomly extract excerpts from the famous FAUST tragedy  
written by the genius Johann Wolfgang Goethe (original in German).

Note: 
The Faust Breviary is the intrinsic default (no additional file required).  
All files `*.frt` must be located *outside* the `c:\windows\system32` folder.  
(As an Example of the *FRT-File Format*, the file `document/haFaust.frt` is provided.)  

Last Update May 2025: *haScreensav.scr*   
Additions: `document/LudwigHohl.frt`  
Changes: `source/haScreensav.cpp` prolonging reading time by pressing `<SPACE>`
